# Client

Client/compatibility - put certain libraries in here like bootstrap.js
Client/stylesheets - put your stylesheets here
Client/views - put all your templates and template helpers/event maps here

It’s best to place templates, events, helpers, and the Meteor.subscribe function inside a “client” folder.

Confusing:
In the lib folder in the root there is also a folder for libraries like bootstrap.js
