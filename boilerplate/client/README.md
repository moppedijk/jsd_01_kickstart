# Client

It’s best to place templates, events, helpers, and the Meteor.subscribe function inside a “client” folder.

`client/compatibility` - put certain libraries in here like bootstrap.js
`client/stylesheets` - put your stylesheets here
`client/views` - put all your templates and template helpers/event maps here
